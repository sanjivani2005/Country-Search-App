Uses the REST Countries API with query parameters to fetch only selected fields:
name, capital, flags, and population.

Displays each country’s flag, name, capital, and population in a card layout.

Uses fetch() to get data, .map() to display cards, and event listeners for live filtering.

Layout is fully responsive using Flexbox, making it mobile-friendly and clean.

✅ Built using: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
✅ Features: API calls, filtering, responsive design, dynamic rendering.
